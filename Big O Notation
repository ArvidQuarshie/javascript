 A function's Big-O notation is determined by how it responds to different inputs. 
 How much slower is it if we give it a list of 1000 things to work on instead of a list of 1 thing? 
 def item_in_list(to_check, the_list):
    for item in the_list:
        if to_check == item:
          return True
    return False
    Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 
    Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used
